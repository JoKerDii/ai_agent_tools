Chosen Company: Multiply
- Reason for Selection: Multiply stands out with its significant revenue growth and profit margins, showcasing strong financial performance and scalability potential in the financial technology sector. The €8.5 million raised funding further underscores its solid market presence and potential for long-term growth, making it the top investment choice.

Companies Not Selected:

1. Bware Labs
   - Reason for Not Being Selected: Despite its promising position as a key player in the Web3 infrastructure space and the potential amplified by its acquisition by Alchemy, Bware Labs lacks the substantial financial performance metrics seen with Multiply. Its investment potential is attractive but carries more uncertainty compared to the financial robustness of Multiply.

2. Neurons Inc.
   - Reason for Not Being Selected: Neurons Inc. faces a highly competitive landscape in marketing analytics with only €6 million in recent funding. While it has the potential for growth through neuroscience-driven marketing, the competitive market and cautious investment outlook make it less attractive compared to the higher-ranked options.

These analyses highlight Multiply's superiority in terms of financial health and strategic positioning, underscoring why it was chosen as the best investment opportunity among the considered companies.
