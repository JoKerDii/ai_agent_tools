After carefully considering the arguments and evidence presented regarding whether AI is going to replace human jobs or create more jobs, I find the side advocating for job creation more convincing. 

The arguments supporting the view that AI will create more jobs are well-supported by numerous studies and data points, presenting a compelling case that surpasses concerns regarding job displacement. 

1. **Net Job Increase**: The evidence from the World Economic Forum indicating that while up to 85 million jobs may be displaced by 2025, approximately 97 million new roles are anticipated, illustrates a significant net gain in employment. This is not merely a replacement argument; rather, it highlights an ongoing evolution in the workplace.

2. **Emerging Job Categories**: The rapid rise in demand for jobs centered around AI—such as data scientists and AI specialists—aims to fill roles that require advanced skills. The statistic from LinkedIn showing a 33% increase in job postings for AI-related positions in just one year is telling. It signifies not just job creation but a response to an evolving technological landscape.

3. **Productivity and Expansion**: AI's potential to enhance productivity allows companies to focus on strategic operations that require human insight. The argument that increased automation can lead to business expansion and subsequently more hiring supports the notion that AI does not merely eliminate jobs but transforms their nature, opening up new opportunities.

4. **Investment in Reskilling**: The commitment from companies like Amazon to invest $700 million toward reskilling their workforce signals a proactive step toward ensuring that displaced workers can transition into newly created roles. This is a critical consideration that showcases a greater societal adaptation to changes in the job market.

5. **Economic Growth**: The prospect of AI contributing up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 aligns with the argument for job creation. Economic expansion historically leads to increased job opportunities, and the potential for higher productivity due to AI integration could spur innovation and new business ventures.

In conclusion, the weight of the evidence presented strongly leans towards the assertion that AI will create more jobs rather than merely replacing them. The focus is on transforming the workforce and expanding job categories while ensuring that workers are equipped to adapt to new roles through reskilling initiatives. This positivity surrounding AI should be embraced, recognizing the transformational opportunities it presents rather than succumbing to the fear of displacement. Hence, I determine that the arguments supporting the job creation perspective are more convincing, advocating for a future where human labor and AI can thrive together, driving progress and prosperity in the job market.
